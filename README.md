A simple dice game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Every time you **refresh the page**, two dice are rolled — one for **Player 1** and one for **Player 2**. The game displays who wins based on the higher dice roll.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- ✅ HTML – for structure
- ✅ CSS – for styling
- ✅ JavaScript – for game logic and DOM manipulation

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. When the page loads (or refreshes), JavaScript generates **two random numbers** between 1 and 6.
2. The dice images are updated based on those numbers.
3. The `<h1>` title changes to announce the winner:
   - “🚩 Player 1 Wins!”
   - “Player 2 Wins! 🚩”
   - Or “Draw!” if both dice are the same.
